### Hi there, I'm Furqan 👋

- 🌱  Graduated from the [Univeristy of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/) in Electronic & Electrical Engineering BEng
- 🔭  I’m currently working as a Data Engineer Consultant at [Xander Talent](https://www.xandertalent.com/)

After graduating from the University of Surrey, I took a roll of a Security Systems Engineer where I developed many technical and soft skills. I then decided to take my career in a much more technical role to challenge myself and align with my aspirations. I am now working at Xander Talent where I am upskilling myself and refamiliarising myself with programming languages such as Python, SQL etc.
