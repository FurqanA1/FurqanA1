### Hi there, I'm Furqan 👋

- 🌱  Graduated from the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/) in Electronic & Electrical Engineering BEng
- 🔭  I’m currently working as a Data Engineer Consultant at [Xander Talent](https://www.xandertalent.com/)
- 🥅  2023 Goals: Maximise my learning, contribute to new projects,
- ⚡  Fun facts: I enjoy going to the gym 🏋️ Playing Football & Basketball⚽ Playing video games 🎮

After graduating from the University of Surrey, I took the role of a Security Systems Engineer where I developed many technical and soft skills within the security industry. I then decided to take my career in a much more technical role to challenge myself and align with my aspirations. I am now working at Xander Talent where I am upskilling myself and refamiliarising myself with programming languages such as Python, SQL and all the principles associated with Data Engineering.
